# Portals
Portals in unity.  
Maybe I will write about it (here) someday.  
[Github repo](https://github.com/ProkopRandacek/Portals)  
I was inspired by [this beautiful video](https://youtu.be/cWpFZbjtSQg) and used it as a codebase.  
I've added a "See trough another different portal when you are looking trough a portal" feature and planning to upgrade it to "See trough unlimited amount of different portals one behind another".
