# Tools
This is a list of software I use and think it is worth of sharing.

***

## OS
- I use Arch BTW

## Desktop environment

- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) - I love how minimalistic it is. I have [this setup](/assets/setup.png)  

## Command line

- [fish](https://fishshell.com) - bash + colors!.. kinda\.\.\. Shell with autosuggestions. Cant live without it.
- [exa](https://the.exa.website) - ls + colors! `alias ls = "exa --group-directories-first"`
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - cat + colors!

## Text editor

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - The ultimate text editor which provides huge amount of key combos for editing text files of any kind.  
- [Vim airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - makes neovim more colorful.  

## Browser

- [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/) - It has got nicer page inspector than Chrome  
- [Tree Style Tab](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab) - Sorts tabs into trees on right of the browser. Absolute necessary extension for browsing the web.  
- [Duck duck go](https://ddg.gg/) - It has got darkmode! Why isn't everyone using this? And also something about privacy
