# Tools
This is a list of software I use and think it is worth of sharing or want to flex about it :D

***

## OS
- I use Arch BTW

## Desktop environment

- [i3](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/I3) - I need fast environment that I can use even on the weak machines I have. (Gnome was lagging my notebook)

## Command line

- [zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zsh) - I don't even know why. Checkout my [.zshrc](https://github.com/ProkopRandacek/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc). I think there are some cool things
- [exa](https://the.exa.website) - ls + colors!
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - cat + colors!

## Text editor

- [Neovim](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Neovim) - The ultimate text editor which provides huge amount of key combos for editing text files of any kind.  
- [Vim airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - + colors!

## Browser

- [Firefox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox) - Chrome is alright too.
- [Tree Style Tab](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab) - Sorts tabs into trees on right of the browser. Absolute necessary extension for browsing the web.  
- [Duck duck go](https://ddg.gg/) - It has got darkmode! Why isn't everyone using this? And also something about privacy.
